# Master Frontend Module 4: Framework - React ⚛️

In the basic exercise we are going to find the list of Github members of the organization indicated by the user.

Endpoint: https://api.github.com/orgs/lemoncode/members

### Statement:

Add an input and a button to filter by organization, that is:

- The lemoncode member list is displayed by default.
- An input is shown that by default has the value: lemoncode.
- The user can type another organization name, for example: microsoft and pressing the search button shows you the members of that organization.
- That when returning from the detail page the organization that had been entered in the filter is shown (for example, if the user entered microsoft, Microsoft should be seen).
